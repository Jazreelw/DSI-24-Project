### Summary of analysis

We started off in the first section of the notebook by data cleaning. Duplicates of rows and alphabet in a column where there should only contain numbers were found in the datasets. Further data cleaning were done to ensure that the columns that were not used on the analysis were removed and columns renamed appropriately.

For ease of user's understanding of the data, 6 graphs were plotted to show the summary of contents in datasets, with focus on the SAT participation rates and also the average scores.

### Conclusions and recommendations

Based on the findings in the notebook, there are quite a number of states that has participating rates of less than 20%. I have listed 3 recommendations below for increase of participation rates.

For these States, if accessibility and traveling time was an issues, the Board can consider opening up more test centres so that they are more accessible for the students to take their examinations. This, along with the other recommendations below, should help to increase participation rates. 

The majority of States that has low participation rates are also the less wealthy States in America. To increase participation in these States, funding and subsidies can be provided for taking the examinations, if students are taking it for the first time. Besides examinations funding, further subsidies can also be provided, for example, University admissions costs.

Also, the board can consider opening up more examination seatings in the year for students to retake the examinations if they are not satisfied with their fees.

Implementing the recommendations above, we should expect to see an increament of SAT participation rates from going forward.
